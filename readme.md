Noid for php
============

[Noid for Php] is a tool to create and manage temporary or permanent nice opaque
identifiers ([noid]) for physical or digital objects or anything else like "12025/654xz321".

This is the php version of a [perl tool] of 2002-2006, still largely used in
libraries, museums and any institution that manage collections and archives, for
example the University of California, the Internet Archive, or the Bibliothèque
nationale de France.

The main goal of this version is for web services, that can create and manage
standard noids without any dependancy. All commands and functions can be used as
in the Perl version, via the command line or via the web.

It is already implemented in [Omeka] and [Omeka S], an open source CMS designed
to expose digitalized documents, via the addons [Ark & Noid for Omeka] and
[Ark for Omeka S].

Other versions exist in [Java] and [Ruby].


Noid Overview
-------------

The noid utility creates minters (identifier generators) and accepts commands
that operate them. Once created, a minter can be used to produce persistent,
globally unique names for documents, databases, images, vocabulary terms, etc.
Properly managed, these identifiers can be used as long term durable information
object references within naming schemes such as ARK, PURL, URN, DOI, and LSID.
At the same time, alternative minters can be set up to produce short-lived names
for transaction identifiers, compact web server session keys, and other
ephemera.

In general, a noid minter efficiently generates, tracks, and binds unique
identifiers, which are produced without replacement in random or sequential
order, and with or without a check character that can be used for detecting
transcription errors. A minter can bind identifiers to arbitrary element names
and element values that are either stored or produced upon retrieval from
rule-based transformations of requested identifiers; the latter has application
in identifier resolution. Noid minters are very fast, scalable, easy to create
and tear down, and have a relatively small footprint. They use BerkeleyDB as the
underlying database.

Identifiers generated by a noid minter are also known as "noids" (nice opaque
identifiers -- rhymes with void). While a minter can record and bind any
identifiers that you bring to its attention, often it is used to generate,
bringing to your attention, identifier strings that carry no widely recognizable
meaning. This semantic opaqueness reduces their vulnerability to era- and
language-specific change, and helps persistence by making for identifiers that
can age and travel well.

See the full description, tutorial and usage on [metacpan], and the list
of available [commands].


Installation
------------

This tool requires the php extension "dba", that is installed by default with
Php, and the BerkeleyDB library, that is installed by default too on standard
web servers and any Linux distribution (package libdb5.3 on Debian), because it
is used in many basic tools.

Simply include the file "lib/Noid.php" in your project and the class "Noid" will
be available. The command line tool is available via "noid.php" or the symbolic
link "noid", but is not required.

### Perl and php

The output of perl (release 5.20 and greater) and php (before and since release
7.1, where the output of `rand()` and `srand()` were [fixed] in the php
algorithm), are the same for integers at least until 32 bits (perl limit, namely
more than 4 000 000 000 identifiers).

**For float numbers, the output is different after the 8192nd value**, so keep
the same language.

Anyway, it is recommended to use php 7.1 or higher, since previous versions of
php are no more supported.

### Automatic test

[PhpUnit] (version 6 or higher) can be used to check the installation via the
command `phpunit` at the root of the tool. Note that the full series of tests
are long, a few dozen of minutes, because the process compares the outputs of
php methods and  perl ones for many seeds.

If you don’t have phpunit, you can do:

```
wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-6.5.phar
// Quick tests.
php phpunit-6.5.phar
// Full tests.
php phpunit-6.5.phar tests
```


Enhancements
------------

[Noid for Php] enhances some points present in the todo list of the Perl script.

- Added the command get_note() to get a user note.
- Added support for alphabets until 89 characters. The character repertoires are:
    - Standard:
        - `d`: `{ 0-9 x }` cardinality 10
        - `e`: `{ 1-9 b-z }` - `{l, vowels}` cardinality 29
    - Proposed:
        - `i`: `{ 0-9 x }` cardinality 11
        - `x`: `{ 0-9 a-f _ }` cardinality 17
        - `v`: `{ 0-9 a-z _ }` cardinality 37
        - `E`: `{ 1-9 b-z B-Z }` - `{l, vowels}` cardinality 47
        - `w`: `{ 0-9 a-z A-Z # * + @ _ }` cardinality 67
    - Proposed, but not accepted for Ark:
        - `c`: Visible ASCII - `{ % - . / \ }` cardinality 89
    - Not proposed in the Perl script, but compatible with Ark and useful
    because the longest with only alphanumeric characters:
        - `l`: `{ 0-9 a-z A-Z }` - `{ l }` cardinality 61


About the port
--------------

### Main purpose

The main purpose of this first conversion is the fidelity to the structure of
the original Perl script: each method has the equivalent code in perl and php
scripts. Furthermore, no dependency is added: the script can be run directly. Of
course, the performance is lower, mainly because the access to the database is
slower: only the generic functions are used, not the ones specific to Berkeley.

### Random noids

When the template is a random one, the order of generated noids is different
between the perl and the php script, because the pseudo-random generated by
these languages are different and in some cases dependent of the platform too.
In Perl, before 5.20.0 (May 2014), rand() calls drand48(), random() or rand()
from the C library stdlib.h in that order. Since 5.20.0, drand48() is
implemented. In Php, rand() uses the underlying C library’s rand (see [rosettacode.org]).

So, the process uses an emulator of the rand() function based on the ground of
the C code (Perl_Random). The use of the Perl rand() is possible via the class
Noid. Anyway, the result will be the same.

### Database

 - Only generic features of database are managed: no environment, no alarm for
 locking. Furthermore, the locking mechanism is different between perl and php,
 so don’t use them at the same time.
 - Php can read and write databases created with the perl script, but the perl
 script cannot access php ones. There is a workaround: copy the three files
 "__db.001", "__db.002" and "__db.003" in the directory "NOID". They come from a
 freshly created minter and are provided with the module in the directory
 "bdbfiles". No advanced check had been done for cross-writing databases.
 - If php and perl are used, the template must not be a random one, because
 seeds are not the same and generated ids are ordered differently.
 - In the php version, the elements can’t be duplicated: dba_replace() is
 systematically used instead of dba_insert(). Anyway, this feature is not
 available in the perl script.
 - In Perl script, $noid is a pointer to data managed from $dbname. To avoid
 this direct access to memory, harder to maintain in a high level language,
 $noid is the $dbname, that points internally to the db handle.

### To do

  - Optimize structure and process, but keep inputs, calls, and outputs.
  - Seperate creation of noids and management of bindings.
  - Use other standard or flat db engines (mysql and simple file).
  - See other todo in the perl or php scripts.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.

For long term noids, all events are saved in a log too.
